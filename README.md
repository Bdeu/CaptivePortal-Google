# Captiveflask

This is a Projekt for Captive Portal Attacks. I advise you to use Wifipumpkin3 if you want to use my Captive Portals.

I must remind you that these types of attacks are illegal. Not only because you are stealing people's data but also because my captive portals are imitations of big companies. Take my Google Captive portal, there is a big logo of google which is against the trademark law.

* Install Wifipumpkin3 
* Download the (e.g.) google.zip and google.py 
* And now you can create a custom captiveflask normally with my .zip

* It is still in German so if you need English you need to change the code
